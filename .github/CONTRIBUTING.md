# 📘 CONTRIBUTING.md — Guía para contribuir a CERCAPP

Welcome to Spotifysaver. This document establishes some conventions and good practices for contributing to the project in an organized and collaborative way. Suggestions and improvements are welcome!

---

### 🧰 Requirements
Before you begin, make sure you have installed:

- Python (> 3.9)
- Poetry (https://python-poetry.org/)
- Git (https://git-scm.com/)
- An editor like VS Code (it is recommended to use the shared configuration in `.vscode/`)

---

### 🌱 Basic workflow

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:gabrielbaute/spotify-saver.git
   cd spotify-saver
   ```

2. **Create a branch for your contribution**:
Use a clear convention:
   - `ft-feature-name` → new feature
   - `fix-bug-name` → bug fix
   - `refactor-module-name` → code improvement
   - `doc-section-name` → documentation

Example:
```bash
git checkout -b ft-fix-single-track-download-error
```

3. **Make clear and atomic commits**:
   - Use the present tense: `Add Spotify link validation`
   - Avoid generic commits like `miscellaneous changes`

4. **Sync with `main` before doing PR**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Use the automatic template
   - Match the PR to the corresponding issue (if applies)
   - Make sure you pass the tests and validations (if applies)

---

### 🧪 Validations and Testing

Before submitting your PR:

- Verify that the current flow is not broken
- If you modify critical logic, document the changes
- If you add features, consider writing tests (although we don't currently use unit tests, we plan to move towards testability)

---

### 🧭 Good Practices

- Maintain modularity: separate logic, validations, and views
- Document new features and services
- Use enums or constants for roles, states, and permissions
- Avoid unnecessary coupling between frontend and backend
- If you refactor, explain why in the pull request
